FILE TYPE INFORMATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Videofield.module for Drupal supports multiple video formats.

.mov, .wmv, .asf, .rm, .3gp, .mp4, .swf, .dir, .dcr
  These files type are supported out the box.
  To play these file types you need to enter in the path to the file.
  If your video is on the same webserver as drupal, you can use a path relative
  to the drupal directory, like "downloads/video.mov".
  If your video is on another server you can enter the URI to the video
  like "http://www.example.com/videos/my-video.mov".
  The .mp4 and .3gp extentions use the Quicktime player.
  The .dir and .dcr extentions use the Director player.

  If you need to add additional object parameters to swf or dir videos you
  can enable the "Allow adding of parameters to object HTML" option. Then
  in the video creation page you will be able to specify the parameters.

.flv
  Videofield.module for drupal supports Macromedia Flash FLV Videos
  using FlowPlayer module.
  To use .flv files simply download and enable Flowplayer module (http://drupal.org/project/flowplayer/).

.ogg
 Ogg Theora videos, videofield.module uses the java applet cortado to display Ogg Theora files,
 you can find the latest version of cortado at http://www.flumotion.net//jar/cortado/
 get http://www.flumotion.net//jar/cortado/cortado-ovt-stripped-0.2.0.jar
 and put it into your Drupal folder as cortado.jar
 [
   NOTE, at the time of writing, cortado.jar had a bug that caused it to fail with drupal.
   you can get a patched version of cortado.jar that works from http://v2v.cc/~j/cortado.jar
   and the bug related to this issue: https://core.fluendo.com/flumotion/trac/ticket/387
